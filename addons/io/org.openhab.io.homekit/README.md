# HomeKit Add-on

This is an add-on that exposes your openHAB system as a bridge over the HomeKit protocol.

Using this add-on, you will be able to control your openHAB system using Apple's Siri, or any of a number of HomeKit enabled iOS apps.
In order to do so, you will need to make some configuration changes.
HomeKit organizes your home into "accessories" that are made up of a number of "characteristics".
Some accessory types require a specific set of characteristics.

## Global Configuration

Your first step will be to create the homekit.cfg in your conf/services folder.
At the very least, you will need to define a pin number for the bridge.
This will be used in iOS when pairing. The pin code is in the form "###-##-###".
Requirements beyond this are not clear, and Apple enforces limitations on eligible pins within iOS.
At the very least, you cannot use repeating (111-11-111) or sequential (123-45-678) pin codes.
If your home network is secure, a good starting point is the pin code used in most sample applications: 031-45-154.

Other settings, such as using Fahrenheit temperatures, customizing the thermostat heat/cool/auto modes, and specifying the interface to advertise the Homekit bridge (which can be edited in PaperUI standard mode) are also illustrated in the following sample:

```
org.openhab.homekit:port=9124
org.openhab.homekit:pin=031-45-154
org.openhab.homekit:useFahrenheitTemperature=true

org.openhab.homekit:thermostatTargetModeCool=CoolOn
org.openhab.homekit:thermostatTargetModeHeat=HeatOn
org.openhab.homekit:thermostatTargetModeAuto=Auto
org.openhab.homekit:thermostatTargetModeOff=Off

org.openhab.homekit:thermostatCurrentModeHeating=Heating
org.openhab.homekit:thermostatCurrentModeCooling=Cooling
org.openhab.homekit:thermostatCurrentModeOff=Off

org.openhab.homekit:networkInterface=192.168.0.6
```

The following additional settings can be added or edited in PaperUI after switching to expert mode:

```
org.openhab.homekit:name=openHAB
org.openhab.homekit:minimumTemperature=-100
org.openhab.homekit:maximumTemperature=100
```

### Overview of all settings

| Setting                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Default value     |
|-------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |---------------    |
| networkInterface          | IP address or domain name under which the HomeKit bridge can be reached. If no value is configured, the addon tries to determine the IP address from the local hostname.                                                                  | (none)            |
| port                      | Port under which the HomeKit bridge can be reached.                                                                                                                                                                                       | 9123              |
| pin                       | Pin code used for pairing with iOS devices. Apparently, pin codes are provided by Apple and represent specific device types, so they cannot be chosen freely. The pin code 031-45-154 is used in sample applications and known to work.   | 031-45-154        |
| useFahrenheitTemperature  | Set to true to use Fahrenheit degrees, or false to use Celsius degrees.                                                                                                                                                                   | false             |

| thermostatOffState        | Word reported by the thermostat when it is currently idle.                                                                                                                                                                                | Off               |

If no thermostat is defined, then all thermostat* settings can be safely ignored / left at their default.

## Item Configuration

After setting this global configuration, you will need to tag your openHAB items in order to map them to an ontology.
For our purposes, you may consider HomeKit accessories to be of two forms: simple and complex.

A simple accessory will be mapped to a single openHAB item (i.e. a Lighbulb is mapped to a Switch, Dimmer, or Color item).
A complex accessory will be made up of multiple openHAB items (i.e. a Thermostat is composed of Heating and Cooling thresholds, a mode, and current temperature).
Complex accessories require a tag on a Group indicating the accessory type, as well as tags on the items it composes.

A full list of supported accessory types can be found in the table below.

| Tag                   | Child tag                         | Supported items           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| LeakSensor            |                                   | Switch, ContactSensor     | Leak sensor. ON / OPEN state means flood detected. |
| MotionSensor          |                                   | Switch, ContactSensor     | Motion sensor. ON / OPEN state means motion detected. |

See the sample below for example items:

```
Switch KitchenLights "Kitchen Lights" <light> (gKitchen) [ "Lighting" ]
Dimmer BedroomLights "Bedroom Lights" <light> (gBedroom) [ "Lighting" ]
Number BedroomTemperature "Bedroom Temperature" (gBedroom) [ "CurrentTemperature" ]

Group gDownstairsThermostat "Downstairs Thermostat" (gFF) [ "Thermostat" ]
Number DownstairsThermostatCurrentTemp "Downstairs Thermostat Current Temperature" (gDownstairsThermostat) [ "CurrentTemperature" ]
Number DownstairsThermostatTargetTemperature "Downstairs Thermostat Target Temperature" (gDownstairsThermostat) [ "TargetTemperature" ]
String DownstairsThermostatHeatingCoolingMode "Downstairs Thermostat Heating/Cooling Mode" (gDownstairsThermostat) [ "homekit:TargetHeatingCoolingMode" ]
String DownstairsThermostatCurrentHeatingCoolingMode "Downstairs Thermostat Current Heating/Cooling Mode" (gDownstairsThermostat) [ "homekit:CurrentHeatingCoolingMode" ]

Switch Hallway_MotionSensor "Hallway Motion Sensor" [ "MotionSensor" ]
Switch Bathroom_OccupancySensor "Bathroom Occupancy Sensor" [ "OccupancySensor" ]
Switch MasterBath_Toilet_LeakSensor "Master Bath Toilet Flood" ["LeakSensor"]
Switch WaterMain_Valve "Water Main Valve" ["Valve"]
Rollershutter MasterWindow_Blinds "Master Window Blinds" [ "WindowCovering" ]
```

## Battery Level

The following devices support report low battery status:

* LeakSensor
* MotionSensor
* SmokeSensor
* CarbonMonoxideSensor
* OccupancySensor

Battery status can be reported via a Number item (0 - 100) tagged as `homekit:BatteryLevel`, or via a Switch item (where ON == battery is low) tagged as `homekit:BatteryLowStatus`. The battery status item must be grouped in with the sensor in question so it can be associated as a composite device. Here's what it looks like to configure a leak sensor with a BatteryLevel:

```
Group gTest_Leaksensor "My Leak Sensor" ["LeakSensor"]
Switch Test_LeakSensor "My Leak Sensor" (gTest_Leaksensor) ["LeakSensor"]
Number:Dimensionless Test_LeakSensorBatteryLevel "My leak sensor battery level" (gTest_Leaksensor) ["homekit:BatteryLevel"]
```

Homekit only supports reporting battery is low, so if using a `Number` item to report battery level, the battery will be reported as low if the value falls under 10 (this will be configurable in a future release).

## Additional Notes

HomeKit allows only a single pairing to be established with the bridge.
This pairing is normally shared across devices via iCloud.
If you need to establish a new pairing, you'll need to clear the existing pairings.
To do this, you can issue the command ```smarthome:homekit clearPairings``` from the OSGi console.

HomeKit requires a unique identifier for each accessory advertised by the bridge.
This unique identifier is hashed from the Item's name.
For that reason, it is important that the name of your Items exposed to HomeKit remain consistent.

If you encounter any issues with the add-on and need support, it may be important to get detailed logs of your device's communication with openHAB.
In order to get logs from the underlying library used to implement the HomeKit protocol, enable trace logging using the following command:

```openhab> log:set TRACE com.beowulfe.hap```
